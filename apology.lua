Hello, I know i've removed Deathsploit 1.0. I was unable to edit it and it was also very stupid of me to leave it on Pastebin. I know I probably shouldnt be writing scripts down just for an apology, but your y'all, i'm remaking Desthsploit 1.0 and calling it the X1 Project. if you own Deathsploit X, check the F9 page. there is a secret binary code there for you to figure out. Thanks, Caleb. - Owner of DS
